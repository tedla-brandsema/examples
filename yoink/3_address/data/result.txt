Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
By William Shakespeare

#START stanza-2
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
#END stanza-2

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

#START stanza-3
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
#END stanza-3

#START stanza-1
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
#END stanza-1
